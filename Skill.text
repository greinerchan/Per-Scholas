Project Management: Jira, SCRUM, Sprints


Jira Software is an agile project management tool that supports agile methodology. So, we use it for our superstart market software development.

We have totally 25 user stories and we ranked them according to the priority. The functions most in needed come at the top of the list. So it is easy to find out what we need to do first just by looking at this list. In the one hand, We think something like login in and log out, search for items, see the past orders, filter the prices are most important features for the users.So we set them at the highest priority. In the other hand, something like visualize discount, request coupons are not that important features, so we could do it later. I think this platform is very useful, in general, how do you guys think about it?
